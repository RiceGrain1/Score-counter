# Score-counter

Beginner level score counter made in JavaScript. Uses multiple functions and onclick="" attributes to add 1, 2, or 3, points to the HOME or GUEST scoreboard.
Reset buttons also use the same method as does the highlighting of the winning team. My goal is to use eventlistners in the future to accomplish the same functionality.
